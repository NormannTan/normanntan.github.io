So it's been about 5 days since the end of my final exams for the year and getting bored, I have been messing about with my computer and reorganizing parts of my workflow that I did not like but could not do during school in case it broke any code or projects.

I've spent a reasonable amount of effort in making sure things work exactly the way I wanted (as best as technology allows. Although it was time consuming, I am pretty satisfied on the way things are right now. So I decided that it would be a good idea to write down what I've done, in case I need to do it again and provide a guideline for people who stumble upon this blog to follow.

In the future posts, I will be blogging mainly about tech and life as an international student. The tech I'm going to blog about is focused on software that help efficient workflow and development as well as tech setups and reviews for an average consumer.
