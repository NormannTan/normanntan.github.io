Hello, my name is Norman Tan.

I'm a Computer Science undergraduate currently studying in Cardiff University.

I love technology and tinkering with things that help improve my workflow and life. I don't like limiting myself to particular tools or technologies. New gadgets and software excites me so I am always looking out for new technologies that can help improve even the simple things in life. This means incorporating them into my workflow and testing them out from a consumer's perspective.

I also love traveling and playing board games. A lot.
